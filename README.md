# mvc-ts

`mvc-ts` is a demonstration of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern implemented in TypeScript.

This design pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. This structure is designed to separate concerns and facilitate more robust, maintainable code. It can be further broken down into separate files.
